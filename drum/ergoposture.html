	<h1>Ergonomics</h1>

	<h2>What is ergonomics in Drumming?</h2>
	<p>It is the concept of the relationship between you and your equipment.Its an important concept that needs to be covered,every drummer should have knowlegde in this field due to the complexity of the instrument,the balance between the body and the drum,the posture,having all four limbs at work,the method of reaching for higher placed instrument,the high risk of injuries and also fatigue.What would be covered in this course is going to lay the foundation \that would prevent actions that hinders good technique ,creativity and playing with ease.</p>


	<h2>Posture</h2>
	<p>Ths is the most important concept when it comes to ergonomics.The stance you take when playing the drum is essential for creating good technique,playing with ease and unlocking creative patterns.Poor posture leads to the opposite result of what good posture has to offer,plus it resulting in fatigue and injuries. It been one of the most important concept,its also the most overlooked one.</p>
	<p>We all have different height,sizes of body and personal preference.So also,our posture for the drum kit is going to be different , what works best for one person may not work at all for another.Therefore the right posture for drumming cant be spelt out,however,there are certain basic principles,we are all expected to know ,follow and use in getting to know the right posture for our individual selves. Once the basic principles are understood and applied,you can find what actually works for you,then ,the sky would be the limit for the ambitous percussive architect

    <h3>Setting the Throne</h3>
    <p>The throne is another name for the drum seat.It is the first thing you'll want to have set up.</p>
    <p>Setup for the throne begins with adjusting it to a comfortable height,although it might feel comfortable to you,it should still be noted that it shouldn't be to low or too high.If the drum throne is too low(knees are higher than hips), we find out that the leg don't give adequate support and the back has to be curved or bent as to provide the support that the leg has failed to give.In this position,we find out that it is hard to play the kick pedal.If we were to play a groove, we find out that we have to hold our arm and hand up ,it creates tension in the entire body.The arm eventually tires out
