    <h1>What are Scales?</h1>

    <p>Scales are not only the building block of the sound,they are entities on which some or most of the other building block rely on,identify with and originate from partially,not enough for the scale to be the only building block of music but just enough for the other basic block to claim affliations with the scale so it be regarded as the first building block after the musical notes</p>

    <p>Scales are series of musical notes {usually contains two or more notes} moving upward and downward with fixed intervals between each notes in such a way that when they are played together ,there is connection between those series of notes and they all fit together to be regarded as a body</p>


    <h2>Types of scales</h2>

    <p>There are more than 200 scales ,examples are</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>north wind scale</li>
    	<li>major scale</li>
    	<li>freygish scale</li>
    	<li>whole tone scale</li>
    	<li>whole half diminished scale</li>
    	<li>in-sen scale</li>
    	<li>ionian scale</li>
    	<li>chromatic scale</li>
    	<li>overtone scale</li>
    	<li>major behop scale</li>
    	<li>major pentatonic scale</li>
    	<li>minor pentatonic scale</li>
    	<li>natural minor scale</li>
    	<li>melodic minor scale</li>
    	<li>harmonic minor scale</li>
    	<li>gypsy scale</li>
    	<li>blues scale</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and a whole lot more</p>

    <h2>Classification of Scales </h2>

    <p>Overwhelmed by the amount of scales we have??</p>

    <p>Scales are majorly classified based on the numbers of their note </p>

    <ol>
    	<li>chromatic scale- contains twelve musical notes in total . they includes the chromatic scale</li>
    	<li>octatonic scale- contains eight musical notes . they  include scales used in jazz and classical music</li>
    	<li>heptatonic / diatonic scale - contains seven notes, they include major and minor scale</li>
    	<li>hexatonic scale _ contains 6 notes,they include whole tones,augmented and blues scales</li>
    	<li>pentatonic scale- they contain five scale, they include the major and minor pentatonic scale (used in rock music and some other musical genre)</li>
    	<li>primitive music scale - these are groups of scale that are no longer in use and have becomed limited to primitve music and limited use in lithurgy
             <li>tetratonic scale- contains 4 notes</li>
             <li>tritonic scale - contains 3 notes</li>
             <li>ditonic scale - contains 2 note</li>
             <li>monotonic scale - contains 1 note</li>

    	</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Identifying And Knowing The Scales</h2>

    <p>With so much scales,you might feel so overwhelmed,based on that you have to be learning a lot to become a versatile musical and also you have to be able to recognise them by sound and by sight when you hear them or see them</p>


    <p>There are some guidelines to identifying this scales ,it is based on four general rule</p>



    <h4>1)  The number / quantity rule</h4>

    <p>The quantity of the notes in a scale is a characteristics that can tell which class the scale belong to on sight or on hearing it</p>



    <p>
    	in the example above,the notes in this listed scale brings about it difference as one is a pentatonic scale and the other is a diatonic scale
    </p>


    <h4>2) The fixed interval/quality rule</h4>

    <p>This is the most common,efficient and reliable way of identifying a scale</p>


    <p>now this example,gives two scales whic by quantity of the notes are classified as pentatonic scales but a change in it interval (C and C#. G and G#), the two changes in the interval between the notes of the scale brings about the difference in the sound of the scale when played</p>

    <p>THE DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF DIFFERENT SCALES are brought about by the change in the interval between its notes,thus change in interval result in change in sound</p>


    <h4>The root note rule</h4>

    <p>The root note abbreviated R is the first note of a scale.The note on which the scale is built upon,the starting point of the scale,it determines the pitch of the scale and is responsible for the choice of musical notes in the scale</p>
    <p>when the quantity and quality of a scale are the same,we can use the root note to identify which is which</p>

    <p>in the example above,we have two scales having the same quantity of notes and quality of the interval between the notes but different root note(starting note),thus they may sound alike ebut one is modulated ,higher in key than the other( or in simpler terms ,one sound higher than the other)</p>



    <h2>Scale formula </h2>

    <p>The scale formula is the specific pattern and arrangement Of note in a given scale in which the scale can move upward and downward </p>

    <p>The pattern and arrangement of note in a given scale is founded upon the three rules governing the identification of scales</p>


    <h3>Characteristics of a scale formula</h3>

    <ol>
    	
    	<li><p>
    		1) fixed quantity of note
		   </p>
		   <li>a scale formula gives the quantity of note in the scale you intend forming </li>


    	</li>
    	<li><p> 2) fixed interval between the notes found in the scale</p>
    		<li>
    			a scale formula gives the quality of the interval between the notes of the scale you intend forming
    		</li>
    	</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Forming Scales with Scale Pattern</h3>

    <p>There are four rules guiding the formation of scale us,they are</p>

    <ol>
    	<li>the notes you use in the scale must be gotten from the 12 musical notes</li>

    	<li>
    		the fixed quantity of notes given in the scale formula must not be exceeded
    	</li>

    	<li>
    		any quality of the interval contrary to that found between the notes of the scale formula would give another scale and not the intended scale
    	</li>
    </ol>



    <h4>Applying all these</h4>

    <p>let say we were given the task of forming a C major scale. The following steps should be how you attempt similar task in the future</p>


    <h5>steps</h5>

    <ol>
    	<li>first find our what type of scale you intend forming. The type of scale in the task above is a MAJOR  SCALE </li>
    	<li>
    		now find out what the scale formula for the major scale is.

    		the formula is R W W H W W W H
    	</li>

    	<li>now get the root note of the scale so we know where to start from. The root note is C</li>

    	<li>
    		begin the counting process and write down the value of each note you land on
    		
    	</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>task</h3>
    <p>form G major scale</p>



    <h2>Scale 001 "The Major Scale" </h2>


    <p>The major scale is the cornerstone  of western music,it is a scale that have some scales,chord,key,appergios and mode dependent on partially or fully,which ever way, they are always related to the major scale in some ways ,the major scale is used to derive the chords</p>


    <p>
    	The sound of the scale is easy to recognize as you would have heard it from "The sound of music song".
    	its a scale that has 7 note ,it has a characteristics happy sound
    </p>
       
    <dl>scale formula</dl>
    <dd>the formula for the major scale is 
    "R W W H W W W H</dd>

    <p>The eight note is usually the same as the first note and is called an octave,the octave is usually double the frequency and pitch of the selected musical note/root note in the scale</p>
