    <h2>A) the acoustic guitar</h2>
    <p>this class of guitar produce their sound acoustically ,hence the name acoustic guitar.what do we mean by the term "acoustically". when the the strings of an acoustic guitar are plucked or strummed ,vibrations are created.</p>

    <p>
    	the vibration created by the motion of the strummed or plucked string are transmitted from the guitar body where it resonates to create a sound wave which is then transmitted through the air which is a medium of transportation for sound waves. This sound wave is then transmitted through the air to our ear where its is perceived as sounds

    <h2>B) the electric guitar</h2>

    <p>unlike the acoustic guitar,which resonates using it body{via the sound hole or box}. the electric guitar doesnt have a sound box or hole.instead it uses a device called PICKUP . it  converts the vibration of the strings into electrical signal</p>


    <p>
    	Now the signal generated by the electric guitar pickup is  too weak to drive a loud speaker . it is therefore plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker whick makes the sound loud and audible enough to hear
