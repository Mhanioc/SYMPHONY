   <h1>Posture</h1>

   <p>The posture one use when playing the guitar,the guitar is an important as what one intends playing because the posture of the guitar player would determine a major  part of how easy what the guitar player intends playing. Bad posture breeds poor technique ,stress when playing and injuries to the body</p>

   <p>Good posture not only enhance your playing ,its your playing. Too bad a lot of problem/roadblocks guitarists today experience majorly stems from poor posture</p>

   <p>So,what is the right posture? posture would differ based on the height of a person,the lenght of his arm, the lenght of the guitar body,how big or small the guitar is and a whole lot of other factors. but there are basic guides a guitarist must adhere to before tweaking and troubleshooting to get his posture</p>


   <p>the rules for positioning thr guitar on the body are based on two factors ,if the guitarist is sitting or standing</p>



   <h3>*Sitting posture/positioning</h3>

   <ol>
   	<li>the legs can be crossed or not,depending on which makes the guitar comfortable,the choice is personal</li>
   	<li>the back should be kept straight to prevent injuries and pain that can result from hunching over to get a good look at the fretboard</li>
   	<li>the wrist should be at a right angle to prevent injury and pain</li>
   	<li>the arm of the fretting hand should be at no more than 90* degrees. The more acute the angle of the arm,the less strain is put on your wrist</li>

   	<li>Rest the dip of the guitar on your lap,the same side as your strumming hand</li>
   	<li>Make sure the elbow(of the strumming hand) point out towards the top corner of the guitar. it should rest as your forearm and wrist can pivot over the string at the same time supporting the body of the guitar slightly rested against your body</li>
   </ol>


   <h2>Standing posture /positioning</h2>

   <p>You would be using a guitar strap in the standing position for an easier and more comfortable playing.in terms of angle and alignment of the arm,wrist and hand,the standing posture is the same as the sitting posture</p>

   <ol>
   	<li>dont lower the straps too much,if the guitar is too low,you would have problem wrapping your fingers around the fretboard neck to play chords and melodies ,too high and you will get the feeling of the guitar choking you when you play.you woul also in this height have to change the angle of your fingers on the fret board to match the very acute angle of the guitar neck.it should therefore be kept at a medium range</li>

   	<li>As a general rule,your fretting arm shulold not be more thand 90 degrees,if the guitar neck is too low,tighten the guitar strap to increase the angle of the neck to a more acute angle,if it is too high ,loosen up the guitar straps to reduce it,vice versa... Remember that you want it at a medium angle so you dont get the choking sensation, it should be at an angle where every you play comes naturally </li>

   	<li>
   		Dont hunch or bend your back backwards. stand straight
   	</li>

   	<li>make sure the forearm is square-on and angled out towards  the top corner of your guitar (not back behind you) so you can pivot smoothly over the strings</li>
   </ol>




   <p>The only way to know you have gotten the right posture is that you're comfortable playing,you dont feel pain playing the guitar after long time, you dont get injured in that posture</p>
