     <h1>Tone Knowlegde</h1>
	 <p>when we hear music, like a song for example,we try to separate the music into various part,and we would often end up with something iike this</p>
	 <ul>
	 	<li>drum or beat</li>
	 	<li>paino or synthetizer</li>
	 	<li>guitar</li>
	 	<li>vocal</li>
	 	<li>bass</li>
	 	<li>violin</li>
	 </ul>

	 <p>and so on</p>



     <p>Going deeper and skimming at the surface at the sound the guitar produces,we discover that the sound the guitar make is not just melodic but its also harmonic in nature,Even at breaking down the sound of the guitar into melody and harmony, we discover that we have just scratched the surface and there are many more underlying components working together to form melody and harmony</p, >

     	<p>Diving deeper,we discover that the basic building block of any melody or harmony are major building blocks and the minor building blocks</p>
         
        <p>Major building blocks</p>
     	<ol>

     		<li>scales</li>
     		<li>chords</li>
     		<li>key</li>
     		
     	</ol>

     	<p>Minor building blocks</p>
     	<ol>
     		
     		<li>chord progressions</li>
     		<li>Appergios</li>
     		<li>modes</li>
     	</ol>


     	<p>Every tone the guitar produces,whether melodic or harmonic in nature are formed from the combinations of these building blocks</p>

     	<p>This part of your guitar training is dedicated to understanding how the sounds the guitar produces works and what the sound is</p>
