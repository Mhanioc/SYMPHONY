	<h2>Introduction to Chords</h2>
	<p>Chords are any set of musical notes consisting of two or more musical notes played in harmony{together or at the ssme time}</p>
	<p>Chords just as musical scale are essential in a guitar musical piece setting.Its harmony blends well into the background of a song and when set to play on it own,it usually steals the show</p>
	<p>Chords in guitar are not to be ignored,as chord are used frequently in western music and other kinds of musical genre like west africa music,oceanic music,western classical music</p>


	<p>Before a collection of note can be considered a chord,they have to relate,this relationship,can be based off the fact that the notes in the chord must be in the same scale</p>


	<p>For example,A C major chord contain the notes,"C E G" in it.All these notes relate by their presence in the C major scale,"C D E F G A B"</p>

	<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF CHORDS</h3>

	<p>Chords can be classified based on the number of notes in them</p>

	<p>1) Dyads - contains two notes,although its commonly called and classified as an interval by people who believe a chord should contain three or more notes.
	Examples include the power chord,tritone,ditone.</p>

	<p>
		2) Traids - contains three notes,they are the most popular and most used chord class.Examples are these are the major chord,minor chord,augmented chord,diminished chord.
	</p>

	<p>Tetrad/ Extended chord - usually contains four notes.Examples are the 6th,7th,9th,11th,13th chords.</p>


	<p>Note : We could play chords with more than 4 notes in them but guitar chord at most can only have up to 4 notes due to the fact that we have just 4 fingers in the fretting hands,only in extreme cases can a guitarist play a 5 note chord by using the thumb of the fretting hand to hold down a note</p>


	<h2>Types Of Chords</h2>
    <p>There are a different types of chords,each with its unique characteristic sound and function,some of the common types are</p>

    <ol>
    	<li>major chord</li>
    	<li>minor chord</li>
    	<li>augmented chord</li>
    	<li>diminished chord</li>
    	<li>Suspended chord</li>
    	<li>6th chord</li>
    	<li>7th chord </li>
    	<li>power chord</li>
    	<li>tritone</li>
    	<li>ditones</li>
    	<li>9th chord</li>
    	<li>11th chord</li>
    	<li>13th chord</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Identifying A Chord</h2>
    <p>Just like the scale,the chords need  identifying else we wont know what we are playing,we're supposed to know when a chord can be called a major chord,a minor chord , a diminished chord,etc.Chords are identified with the same rules used in identifying scales</p>
    <h4>1)THE QUANTITY RULE</h4>
    <p>The number of notes in a given type of chord tells a lot about the identity of the chord.For example</p>

    <h4>2)THE QUALITY RULE</h4>
    <p>This rule can also be used to identify chord based on the interval between its notes.The quality rule defines the sound of the chord.For example</p>



    <h4>3THE )ROOT NOTE RULE</h4>
    <p>This rule identifies and tends to differentiate chords with the same quality and quantity based on what the base/root note of the chord is</p>




    <h2>Chord Formulae</h2>
    <p>Similar to the scale formula is the specific pattern of different chords.The formula is also as important as the scale formula as it serves the purpose of creating chords</p>

    <h3>Forming Chord With The Chord Formula</h3>
    <p>The rules for using the chord formula is the same as that used for the scale formula.Just little different</p>
    <h3>Rule 1</h3>
    <p>Chord are formed from a scale(usually the major scale),its the most commonly used and widely accepted scale for forming chord,the minor scale can also be used</p>

    <h3>Rule 2</h3>
    <p>A Chord formula usually have specified number of it notes / it follows the quantity of notes in the chord</p>

    <h3>Rule 3</h3>
    <p>A Chord formula usually have a fixed interval between its notes/ it follows the quality rule</p>

    <h3>Rule 4</h3>
    <p>It would finally follow the root note rule.The root note of a chord just like in the scale is the note upon which the other notes in the chords are built upon</p>


    <p>Knowing the rules,we can at once begin to form chords as far as we know the chord formula for the designated chord</p>

    <p>As an example,we would be forming the C Major Chord and G Major chord. C and G representing the root note, and The Major representing the formulae we are going to be using</p>


    <h2>Forms of Guitar Chords</h2>

    <h2>CHORDS FOR THIS LEVEL</h2>
    <h2>Major Chord</h2>

    <p>The Major Chord is one of the most commonly used type of chord.It has a characteristic happy sound which brightens up a song </p>

    <p>Chord Formulae- The Major Chord chord formulae is 1 3 5</p>

    <h4>Basic Open Major Chord</h4>

    <h2>Minor Chord</h2>
    <p>The Minor Chord is also one of the most commonly used type of chord.it has a characteristics sad and dull sound</p>

    <p>Chord Formulae- The Minor Chord formulae is 1 3 5</p>

    <h4>Basic Open Minor Chord</h4>
