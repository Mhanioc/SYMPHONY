	<h1>Intervals</h1>

	<h2>What are intervals?</h2>

	<p>In music an interval is basically the distance in pitch between two notes </p>

	<h2>Classifications of intervals</h2>

	<p>intervals can be classified based on various criteria,some of them which includes </p>


	<h4>Melodic and harmonic intervals</h4>

	<p>-Melodic intervals a.k.a horizontal or linear interval are intervals played successively,one after the other or separately</p>
	<p>Melodic interval are always seen at work,when we play the melody of a song,the notes are played one after the other</p>

	<p>-Harmonic intervals aka vertical intervals are intervals gotten from playing two notes simultaneously(together)</p>
	<p>harmonic intervals are sounds we hear when instruments play two notes together</p>

	<h4>Diatonic and Chromatic intervals</h4>
	<p>-DIATONIC INTERVALS  are the distance between the notes found in the diatonic scale.this distance between the notes may vary depending on the amount of whole steps and half steps in between the notes of the scale</p>

	<p>-CHROMATIC INTERVALS are the distance between the notes found in the chromatic scale or the intervals formed based on the distance of the notes found in the chromatic scale</p>
	<p>The distance in the chromatic scale is always an half step</p>

	<h5>differences between the  diatonic and chromatic interval</h5>

	<p>Because of the half and whole step difference between the two scale, the characteristics of the intervals found in the scale would differ, example of such characteristics includes </p>

	<ol>
		<li>the quality</li>
		<li>the quantity</li>
	</ol>
    

    <h2>Characteristic of an interval</h2>


    <p>In Western music theory, an interval always has two characteristics,  its number (also called diatonic number) and quality.it is with this characteristic that intervals are named</p>

    <p>
    	For instance, major third (or M3) is an interval name, in which the term major (M) describes the quality of the interval, and third (3) indicates its number.
    </p>


    <h4>The Quantity</h4>
    <p>The quantity or number of an interval is the number of count it spans</p>
    <p>This characteristics determine how far two notes are from each other or better still it is the numbered distance between two or more note</p>
    <p>example</p>

    <p>also,its is the number of an interval is the number of letter names it encompasses or staff positions it encompasses.</p>
    <p>Intervals can be counted using the staff which is also the chromatic scale arranged vertically and the diatonic scale usually with the major scale</p>

    <h5>Diatonic scale counting</h5>

    <p>in the diatonic scale counting ,the major scale is used. </p>
    <p>Counting is done by picking the first note and counting up till we reach the note we want to end at</p>

    <p>counting in the example above from C- G is 5</p>
    <h5>Chromatic scale counting</h5>
    <p>Same concept as when we dealt with a chromatic scale,only this time we use the chromatic scale instead of a diatonic scale</p>

    <p>in the example above we have the distance between C - G to be 8</p>
    <p>This is the reason interval numbers are also called diatonic numbers, and this convention is called diatonic numbering.</p>

    <h5>Quantity and their name</h5>

    <ul>
    	<li>unison-1</li>
    	<li>second -2nd</li>
    	<li>third-3rd</li>
    	<li>fourth-4th</li>
    	<li>fifth-5th</li>
    	<li>sixth-6th</li>
    	<li>seventh-7th</li>
    	<li>octave-8ve</li>
    	<li>ninth-9th</li>
    	<li>tenth-10th</li>
    	<li>eleventh-11th</li>
    	<li>twelfth-12th</li>
    	<li>thirteenth-13th</li>
    </ul>
    



    <h4>The Quality</h4>
    <p>The name of any interval is further qualified using the terms perfect (P), major (M), minor (m), augmented (A), and diminished (d). This is called its interval quality. The quality of an interval is based of the quantity of the interval in the diatonic scale(in rare conditions chromatic scales). 
    </p>


    <h5>Perfect</h5>
    <p>
    	
        A perfect interval identifies the distance between the first note of a major scale and the unison, 4th, 5th or octave.   Only those intervals can be given the extra attached name as “perfect”.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Within a diatonic scale[d] all unisons (P1) and octaves (P8) are perfect. Most fourths and fifths are also perfect (P4 and P5), with five and seven semitones respectively.They are labeled as “perfect” because the sound quality is much different from any other intervals.
    	A perfect interval does not have to include the first note of the major scale.  As long as both notes are found in the same major scale, they are considered diatonic intervals.  Using half steps as your guide will really help you determine what quality of intervals they are.
    </p>

    <h5>Major and Minor intervals</h5>

    <p>
    	A perfect interval identifies the distance between the first note of a major scale and the 2nd,3rd ,6th and 7th notes of the diatonic scale. Only those intervals can be given the extra attached name as "Major or Minor"

    </p>



    <h5>Augmented and Diminished Intervals</h5>
    <p>Augmented intervals are wider by one semitone than perfect or major intervals, while having the same interval number (i.e., encompassing the same number of staff positions). Diminished intervals, on the other hand, are narrower by one semitone than perfect or minor intervals of the same interval number. For instance, an augmented third such as C–E♯ spans five semitones, exceeding a major third (C–E) by one semitone, while a diminished third such as C♯–E♭ spans two semitones, falling short of a minor third (C–E♭) by one semitone.
    The augmented fourth (A4) and the diminished fifth (d5) are the only augmented and diminished intervals that appear in diatonic scales[d] (see table).</p>



     <h4>Shorthand notations</h4>

     <p>Intervals can be abbreviated with a P for perfect,m for minor, M for major, d for diminished, A for augmented, followed by the interval number. The indication M and P are often omitted. The octave is P8, and a unison is usually referred to simply as "a unison" but can be labeled P1. The tritone, an augmented fourth or diminished fifth is often TT. The interval qualities may be also abbreviated with perf, min, maj, dim, aug. Examples: </p>
