	<p>For any sound you hear,it has 4 identifiable properties or should we say characteristic or even features,anyone you choose, they are : pitch,tone,intensity,duration and timbre. No matter how a song composition may seem complex and complicated,these four features are the only ingredient musicians(composers and performers) have to work with</p>

	<p>Pitch - its the highness or lowness of a sound.The difference in the frequency of the sound wave is what we hear as the the difference in the pitch of a sound.The greater the number of sound waves produced  per second of an elastic body,the higher the sound we hear,the fewer sound wave produced,the lower the sound,hence why the fattest string of a guitar which vibrates slowly have a lower pitch than the thinnest string which vibrates faster hence have a higher pitch. The faster a thing can vibrate,the higher the frequency of the sound wave produced,the higher the pitch of the sound we hear. </p>

	<p>Tone - it's a musical sound of definite pitch. There are only 12 possible definite pitch hence why we have only 12 musical notes in music</p>
	<p>Intensity - which is also known as the amplitude is heard as the loudness or softness of a pitch. Intensity from Acoustics(the scientific study of sounds),it is the amount of energy affecting the vibrating body, its measured on a scale from 0 to 130 in units called Decibels by scentist. In musical notations,graduations of intensity are indicated with the following italian words and their abbreviations: pianosimmo,forte</p>
	<p>Duration - it is the lenght of time something last,in the case of music,that something being a pitch or a tone,duration would be how long a pitch or a tone is sounded.</p>
