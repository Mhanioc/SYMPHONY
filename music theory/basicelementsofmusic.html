		<p>Music at the mots basic level are just sounds arranged in time and time structured by sound in a way that is pleasant to its hearer.</p>
		<p>The basic elements of music are sound and time.Listen,sing or play an instrument to any song,you would find this to be true</p>
		<p>when you listen,sing or play an instrument to any song,you notice you are either producing or making sounds,so it's important at this stage to understand the basic elements of music or in other words the essential material or ingredients that make up music.</p>
		<p>Sound is anything you can hear.It's the sensation perceived by the organs of hearing when vibrations which are typically sound waves reach the ear. Sounds are used to struture time in music</p>
		<p>Time is a quantity used to make reference to before and after an event has occurred.Time occurs in the duration of the sounds and the silences between sounds. </p>

		<p>Now looking at the definition of music,we get the basic ideas of what makes music music.</p>
		<p>Nice sounds arranged in the wrong timing is what we call playing off-beat or making noise</p>
		<p>Nice timing structured by poor arrangement and harmonization of sound is what we call playing off-key or makinng noise</p>
		<p>So any sound that isn't arranged well in good timing is what we call making noise.You can imagine two kids fighting for a ball and been the elder one you collect the ball from them so they stop fighting.After doing this ,they start crying, you are overwhelmed by the poor sounds that they are making,they are making sound but its just coming out as noise because it doesn't have it's sound harmonized properly and it comes out at irregular,hence the definition of noise</p>
		<p> Noise at it basic level are just sounds that are not arranged in time and it's time is structured by sound in a way that is unpleasant to it's hearer.</p>

		<p>Every music theory or music related are focused on how to combine these two basic elements of music in the best way to create music </p>

		<p>Terms used in Music Theory</p>
		<p>Vibration - it is the periodic/continuous motion of a substance.When we sing,the vocal cord creates vibrations,likewise,when we play an instrument,part of the instrument(The strings,The sounding board,etc) and the air inside and around the instrument vibrates</p>
		<p>Compression and Rarefaction - This refer to the alternation of increased(compression) and decreased(rarefaction) pressure in the air caused by an activated (vibrating) surface or air column.
		One complete cycle of compression and rarefaction produces a sound wave or vibration</p>
		<p>Frequency - it is the rate at which sound or waves vibrate,also the number of compression-rarefaction cycle that occurs per unit of time(which is a second).</p>
		<p>Audible sounds for the human ear range from 20 - 20,000 cycles per second,wow that's a lot</p>

		<p>Note - Sound are what we hear,they are caused by the influence sound wave have on our ear after it has been perceived </p>
