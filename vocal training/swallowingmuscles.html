	<h2>Swallowing Muscles Deactivation</h2>
	<p>The Swallowing Muscles are usually activated when we swallow food or liquid.You can feel their action by placing the finger on the voice box(larynx) and performing a swallowing action. We would feel the rising of this voice box,its a reflex action.</p>
    <h3>why we use these muscles</h3>

    <p>When we swallow/engage our swallowing muscles. we tend to close our vocal folds together which makes air pressure 	build up underneath the vocal folds which in turn raises our larynx.
		The next thing that happens during the swallowing phases is that our tongue pulls back in order to guide food down into our stomach.
		The first phase of the swallowing mechanism is very similar to pop singing techniques. We first close our vocal folds,which allows air pressure to builds up and we raise our larynx. Now what do you think happens next, you guessed it right!!! our tongue would naturally then want to pull back.
		A major portion of vocal training is reorientating our body on the fact that we are not swallowing and our tongue doesnâ€™t need to pull back. We need our tongue to stay relaxed, or actually slightly forward.

	<p>Another reason you are using your swallowing muscles to sing is because you do not have your abdominal muscles engaged. Your poor neck and head are trying to do all the work instead. Take the neck and facial muscles out of the equation and you will find yourself relying far more on your core support, as you should.</p>



	<h3>Deactivating it</h3>
	<h4>SOlution !</h4>
	<p>Using <a href="diaphramaticsupport.html">diaphramatic support</a> </p>

	<h4>Solution 2</h4>
	<p> For this,You will need to hold up one hand to your throat while you are singing so you can monitor the movement of your voice box and the swallowing muscles. </p>

	<p>Since we are actually training pur body to counter the reflex action of the swallowing muscles and the tong retracting back, we are going to be practicing some ecercise with the tongue extended / potruded. Check our the <a href="protrudedtongue.html">protruded tongue technique</a> </p>

	<p>Having known the potruded tongue technique,this way,we can learn to start creating sound without the need for retracting the tongue which causes tension</p>


	<p>Start humming on any familiar exercise you are comfortable with or within your skill level, it can be the five notes scale,1-3-4 appergio scale,glides ,one and a half octave scale,etc...Depend on what you want and what is within your skill range</p>


	<p>Once you are comfortable with the potruded tongue position,move onto a vowel ,keeping the tongue resting on your lower lips.YOu can begin with the "A" vowel sound as in LAH.After getting it down with the "A" sound,move on to the other vowel sounds and finally start singing song using this technique.</p>

	<h4>Solution 3</h4>
	<p>In this exercise ,the focus is you should not feel your swallowing muscles coming down.You are going to have to use your thumb as a device again to monitor the movement of the swallowing muscle.  The sound we would be using for this exercise is the "A" Sound as in NEY.You can do it on any scale but the octave repeat scale is a good starting point.YOu should be thinking down,not about how high the notes are.Keep your muscles relaxed.The more you go higher ,you should change into your head voice..</p>

	<p>NOTE that no matter how long it takes to perfect an exercise,don't move to another one.Pay attention to how the exercise feels, not how it looks.If your muscles tighten up,stop and start again</p>
